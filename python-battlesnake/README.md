# A [Battlesnake](http://play.battlesnake.com) written in Python

This snake is derived from [starter-snake-python](https://github.com/BattlesnakeOfficial/starter-snake-python). Please see that readme for instructions on hosting your snake and competing.

## Running tests

```python -m unittest``` for unittests

and 

```python test_scenarios.py``` for scenario tests




## Running server locally

Eventually you might want to run your Battlesnake server locally for faster testing and debugging. You can do this by installing [Python 3.8](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or above and running:

```shell
python server.py
```
